## What does it do? 
- Currently, it's primary purpose is to generate analytical data on blackjack win/loss statistics through simulated blackjack games, which can either be played manually by the user against the artificial casino, or enabling automatic play (letting the AI play) which utilizes strategy books to play many games at incredibly high speeds for generation of large datasets of win/loss statistics.

- It's secondary purpose is to allow users to refine and their blackjack playing skills with optional hints being provided by the AI for every game, and it also serves as a playground to test new strategies and get statistical feedback on the effectiveness of them.
